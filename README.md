# This is the code that accompanies my thesis tittled "Like Father Like SON"

finetuning.ipynb is the code used to finetune the llama 7b model to our visualization task

rlhf-bert.ipynb then takes this finetuned model and performs reinforcement learning on it, using the SON model I made outlined in my thesis.

For a detailed description of the SON and how it works please read through Thesis.pdf
